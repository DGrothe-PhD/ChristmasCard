I wanted to have some festive fun with JavaScript and CSS so created this rather cool e-card. 

The animated snow is created using a HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It is adapted from the following tutorial https://dev.to/codebubb/javascript-snow-52im

Feel free to fork it and create your own Christmas e-card!
